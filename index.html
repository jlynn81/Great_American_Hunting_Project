			<h2><strong>Hunting Inspiration</strong></h2>
		
				<p>Hunting comes from all backgrounds and it is not just a mans sport anymore.
				   Woman have been joining the hunt for many years now and it is not uncommon
		           to see a woman by a mans side within the deer stand or behind a turkey blind.</p>  
		        	<aside>
		        		<blockquote>
		        			<strong>"If some animals are good at hunting and others are suitable for 
		        			hunting, then the Gods must clearly smile on hunting."</strong>(Aristotle 384 BC-322 BC)
		        		</blockquote>
					</aside>
		        <p>The American spirit of hunting is starting to overcome the populous due to 
		           the ever growing need to support one's family in these troubling times of economic
		           peril.  It is through hunting that we go back to our roots and find ways to survive
		           within the lands we have grown to love and cherish.</p>
		           
		        <p>As you travel through the pages, I hope that you find the information
		        informative as well as enlightening as an easy to go through page 
		        for your hunting needs no matter how big or small.</p>
