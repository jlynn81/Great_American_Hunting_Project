		<h2>Hunting Inspiration</h2>
		<p>Hunting comes from all backgrounds and it is not just a mans sport anymore.
		Woman have been joining the hunt for many years now and it is not uncommon
		to see a woman by a mans side within the deer stand or behind a turkey blind.
		
		The American spirit of hunting is starting to overcome the populous due to 
		the ever growing need to support one's family in these troubling times of economic
		peril.  It is through hunting that we go back to our roots and find ways to survive
		within the lands we have grown to love and cherish.</p>
