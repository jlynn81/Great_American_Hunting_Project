		<p>Every state has a hunting club, check with the local Game and Wildlife 
			commission to find out if there is an organization or club near you that you
			would like to be a part of. There are more clubs and organizations out there that would love to have
			you be apart of them.  Check around and see what is close and I'm sure
			that you are bound to have a great hunting experience.</p>
